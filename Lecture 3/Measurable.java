public interface Measurable{
    void measure(); // This method is called an abstract method
    // An abstract method is a method you have to write code for and override

    // Fact 1: An interface needs 0 or more abstract methods
    // Fact 2: Can have infinite abstract methods but would be similar to hell on earth to program (so bad)
    // Fact 3: Can not hold information: No variables! (This is slightly a lie but ignore)
    // Fact 4: Can not CONSTRUCT an interface
    // Fact 5: Can only hold abstract methods (Also slightly a lie, ignore)
